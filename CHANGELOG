Version 2.4
    the default system changed a bit: players will now spawn at the neares or soulbound shrine. using /reb removes 15% of their items. there is a blacklist which excludes certain items from being removed.
        default values are
            dropping: false
            pvpDrop: true
            reverseSpawning: true 
    added resurrection time (default 10 seconds). if the player moves the resurrection is canceled.
    added a notification for ghosts if they enter a shrine area. this only applies if the "shrineOnly" option is true. by default it's deactivated.
    shrines now have a spawn point. they can be set (at the location you are standing) by using /shrine setSpawn <name>. this is useful for large shrines such as cathedrals or graveyards
    MobArena is now supported
    spout: the texturepack for ghosts is now changeable
    spout: ghosts hear now ghast noises
